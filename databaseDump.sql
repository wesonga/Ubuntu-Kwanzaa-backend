If you have had one, or know someone who has, you are not alone. Many people recover from a heart attack and continue to live productive lives afterward.','Chest pain or discomfort,which may involve a feeling of pressure,tightness or fullness,Pain or discomfort in one (usually the left arm) or both arms or shoulder,the jaw,neck,back or stomach,Shortness of breath,Feeling dizzy or lightheaded,Nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting (being sick),Sweating,Coughing or wheezing,An overwhelming feeling of anxiety (feeling as a panic attack)','# Causes\n\nHeart attack is caused by an interruption in the flow of blood to the heart. If this supply is not available, heart muscles may begin to die as a result of damage. As a result of damage to a significant portion of the heart, the heart stops beating (known as a cardiac arrest), causing death.\n\n## Coronary heart disease\n\nThe most common cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease (CHD). The coronary arteries (the main blood vessels supplying blood to the heart) become clogged with cholesterol deposits in CHD. These deposits are called plaques. When a plaque ruptures (bursts), a blood clot forms at the ruptured site, causing a heart attack. A clot may block blood flow to the heart, triggering a heart attack. Your risk of developing CHD is increased by:\n\n- smoking\n- a high-fat diet\n- diabetes\n- high cholesterol\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- being overweight or obese\n\nOther causes of heart attack include:\n- *Drug misuse* – Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines (speed) and methamphetamines (crystal meth) can narrow coronary arteries, inhibiting blood flow and causing a heart attack. One of the most common causes of sudden death in young people is a heart attack caused by cocaine use.\n- *Lack of oxygen in the blood (hypoxia)* – When the levels of oxygen in the blood decrease due to carbon monoxide poisoning or loss of normal lung function, the heart receives blood that is not oxygenated. Consequently, heart muscle damage will occur, triggering a heart attack.\n\n# Prevention\nKeeping a healthy lifestyle is not only your best defense against heart disease and stroke, but it is also your responsibility. Here are some tips for leading a heart-healthy lifestyle. Follow these simple steps to reduce all modifiable risk factors for [heart disease](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/what-is-cardiovascular-disease/coronary-artery-disease), heart attack, and stroke.\n- *Stop smoking* ****– If you smoke, quit. If someone in your household smokes, encourage them to quit. We know it\'s tough. But recovering from a heart attack or stroke or living with chronic heart disease is much more challenging.\n- *Choose good nutrition* – A healthy diet is one of the best weapons against cardiovascular disease. You can control other risk factors by controlling your diet (and even the amount you consume): cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Rather than nutrient-poor foods, choose nutrient-rich foods - which contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutrients. It is important to consume a diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; that includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and that limits sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meat consumption. It is also important to coordinate your diet with your physical activity level to ensure that you are burning as many calories as you consume.\n- *High blood cholesterol - The* accumulation of fat in your arteries is a disaster waiting to happen. It may eventually lead to a heart attack or stroke. Make sure that you reduce your intake of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol and get moving.\n- *Lower high blood pressure-* This is a major risk factor for stroke, the leading cause of disability in the United States. Get moving, quit that salt habit, and take your medications as directed by your physician. Those numbers need to get down and stay down. The ****blood pressure should not exceed 120/80 mmHg.\n- *Be physically active every day* – Studies have shown that moderate-intensity physical activity can reduce blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and maintain a healthy weight. And something IS better than nothing. Start slowly if you are inactive now. A few minutes of activity at a time can have a beneficial effect on your health.\n- *Reduce stress* – Some studies have shown that [](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/what-is-cardiovascular-disease/coronary-artery-disease)stress can affect the risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Stress, for example, may cause people to overeat, start smoking, or smoke more than they typically would. The research has even demonstrated that the stress reaction in young adults is a significant predictor of middle-age high blood pressure.\n- *Limit alcohol* – Excessive drinking can result in increased blood pressure, cardiomyopathy, stroke, cancer, and other diseases. It can also contribute to high triglyceride levels and irregular heartbeats. A high level of alcohol consumption is associated with obesity, alcoholism, suicide, and accidents.','[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Find the patient\",\n    \"description\": \"Follow the directions shown on the map to find the best route to the patient.

In some cases, cardiac arrest survivors can recover if treatment is initiated immediately. If a person is left without oxygen-containing blood being pumped to the brain for a prolonged period of time, there is less chance that they will be revived, and if they are, permanent brain damage will result.\n\nThe probability of brain damage increases if cardiac arrest lasts for more than 5 minutes without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If cardiac arrest persists longer than eight minutes, there is a high risk of death. In order to prevent cardiac arrest, CPR must be initiated as soon as possible.','loss of consciousness (fainting),racing heartbeat,feel dizzy,light-headed,chest pain,shortness of breath,nausea,vomiting in the hour before SCA','# Causes\n\nNearly every known heart condition can lead to cardiac arrest.\n\nIn most cases, cardiac arrests occur as a result of malfunctions in the heart\'s electrical system. A malfunction of the heart results in abnormal heart rhythms such as [ventricular tachycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/tachycardia--fast-heart-rate) or [ventricular fibrillation](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/ventricular-fibrillation). There are also cases of cardiac arrest caused by a severe slowing of the heart\'s rhythm ([bradycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/bradycardia--slow-heart-rate)).\n\nThese irregular heartbeats carry a high risk of death.\n\nOther causes of cardiac arrest include:\n\n- *Scarring of the heart tissue* – This may be caused by previous heart attacks or by other factors. When there is scarring or enlargement of the heart, it is more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias that are life-threatening. Patients with atherosclerotic heart disease are at high risk for sudden cardiac arrest within the first six months after a heart attack.\n- *Thickened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)* – Heart muscles can be damaged by high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or any other factor. It is possible to experience sudden cardiac arrest if you have a diseased heart muscle, especially if you have heart failure as well.\n- *Heart medications* – Certain heart medications may be associated with arrhythmias that can result in sudden cardiac arrest. (Oddly, antiarrhythmic medications that treat arrhythmias may occasionally cause ventricular arrhythmias even at normal doses. This is referred to as a \"proarrhythmic effect”.) It is also possible to experience life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiac arrests as a result of significant changes in the levels of potassium and magnesium in the blood (such as from the use of diuretics.\n- *Electrical abnormalities* – These, including [Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/other-heart-rhythm-disorders) and [Long QT syndrome](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/conduction-disorders), may cause sudden cardiac arrest in children and young people.\n- *Blood vessel abnormalities* – These rare conditions typically occur in the coronary arteries and aorta. The release of adrenaline during intense physical activity may trigger sudden cardiac arrest when these abnormalities are present.\n- *Recreational drug use* – It can happen even to healthy people.\n\n# Prevention\nKeeping a healthy lifestyle is not only your best defense against heart disease and stroke, but it is also your responsibility.

In the United States, it is one of the leading causes of death and disability.\n\nIn strokes, blood vessels that transport oxygen and nutrients to the brain are blocked by clots or burst (or rupture). Consequently, a part of the brain and its cells die when it cannot receive enough blood (and oxygen).\n\nA stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.

A brain injury, disability, or even death may result from this.\n\nThere are 2 main causes of strokes:\n\n- *ischaemic* – occurs when blood clots prevent blood flow, accounting for 85% of cases\n- *haemorrhagic* – caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain\n\nAdditionally, there is a condition called a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) in which the brain\'s blood supply is temporarily disrupted.\n\nThis causes what\'s known as a mini-stroke. It can last a few minutes or persist up to 24 hours.\n\nIt is important to treat TIAs promptly, as they often indicate the risk of having a full stroke in the near future. Seek medical advice as soon as possible, even if your symptoms improve.\n\nCertain conditions increase the risk of having a stroke, including:\n\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- high cholesterol\n- irregular heart beats (atrial fibrillation)\n- diabetes\n\n# Prevention\n\nStrokes can be significantly reduced if you:\n\n- Maintain a healthy diet\n- Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy lifestyle\n- Drink alcohol in moderation (no more than 14 units per week).\n- Getting rid of tobacco\n\nIt is important to manage any condition that increases your stroke risk. A common example would be taking medication to lower high blood pressure or cholesterol levels.\n\nYou should take these measures particularly if you have previously suffered a stroke or TIA, since your risk of having another stroke is greatly increased.','[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Find the patient\",\n    \"description\": \"To find the best route to the patient, follow the directions shown on the map.

The heart rate in atrial fibrillation is irregular and often very fast. In some cases, it can be considerably higher than 100 beats a minute.\n\nSymptoms of this condition include dizziness, shortness of breath, and fatigue. If you have noticeable heart palpitations, your heart may beat irregularly, flutter or pound for a few seconds or, in some cases, for a few minutes.\n\nOccasionally, atrial fibrillation does not cause any symptoms, and the patient is unaware of the irregular heart rate.

However, this does not imply that the condition cannot be serious. The most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nHeart chambers may become stiff, resulting in back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. As a result, heart failure symptoms are sometimes exacerbated as well as abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Additionally, you are more likely to develop a heart infection (endocarditis).\n\nAs a result of these changes, you may experience dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, and temporary loss of consciousness.\n\nYour doctor will need to monitor your condition regularly if you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.','2'),(9,'Restrictive cardiomyopathy','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition.

There are three parts to a normal valve (leaflets or cusps), but in a stenotic valve, there may only be one cusp (unicuspid) or two cusps (bicuspid), which are thick and stiff rather than thin and flexible.\n\nSymptoms of aortic valve stenosis may include:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n- Exercise intolerance\n- Dizziness\n- Chest pain\n- Abnormal heart rhythms','3'),(11,'Atrial Septal Defect','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','This is an opening or a hole (defect) in the wall (septum) that separates the two upper chambers of the heart (atria).\n\nAs a result of this defect, oxygen-rich blood leaks into oxygen-poor blood chambers in the heart.

The septum is a wall that divides the left and right sides of the heart.\n\nSymptoms of an atrial septal defect may include:\n\n- Mild shortness of breath (especially with exercise)','3'),(12,'Pulmonary valve stenosis','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','A pulmonary valve opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. The narrowing of the pulmonary valve (valvar pulmonary stenosis) causes the right ventricle to pump more vigorously in order to push blood around the blockage.\n\nIt is usually unknown what causes the condition. Babies born to mothers who had rubella (German measles) while pregnant were more likely to develop pulmonary stenosis, deafness, and patent ductus arteriosus. Some patients have other heart defects.\n\nSymptoms of pulmonary valve stenosis may include:\n\n- Chest pain\n- Exercise intolerance',''),(13,'Ventricular Septal Defect','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Ventricular Septal Defect is a hole or opening in the wall (septum) separating the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).\n\nWhen the fetus is developing normally, the wall between the two chambers closes, so that by birth, oxygen-rich blood is not mixed with oxygen-poor blood. An unclosed hole may lead to increased heart pressure and reduced oxygen to the body.\n\nThe cause of this condition is not known in the majority of cases, but genetic factors may be involved.\n\nSymptoms of a ventricular septal defect may include:\n\n- Shortness of breath',''),(14,'Heart failure','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','The term heart failure sounds like the heart is no longer working at all. Actually, heart failure refers to the heart pumping less efficiently than it should.\n\nIn order for the body to receive oxygen and nutrients, the heart pumps blood to the cells. In the case of heart failure, the weakened heart is unable to provide sufficient blood to the cells. It can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and excessive coughing in some people. Taking care of daily tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, or carrying groceries can be challenging.\n\nAlthough it can occur at any age, it is most commonly observed in older adults. Heart failure tends to worsen over time as it is a lifelong condition. The symptoms usually cannot be cured. However, many people with heart failure lead a fulfilling, enjoyable life when they take heart failure medications and maintain a healthy lifestyle.','2'),(15,'Coronary Artery Disease','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Coronary artery disease is caused by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries, which interrupts the heart\'s blood supply. It is one of the leading causes of death in the world.\n\nYour arteries can become furred up with fat deposits over time. It is known as atherosclerosis, and the fatty deposits are known as atheromas.\n\nFactors such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can contribute to atherosclerosis. In addition, if you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension), or diabetes, you are more likely to develop atherosclerosis.\n\nSymptoms of coronary artery disease may include:\n\n- Chest pain (angina)\n- Shortness of breath\n- Pain throughout the body\n- Feeling faint\n- Feeling sick (nausea)\n\nHowever, not all individuals experience the same symptoms, and some may not have any symptoms before the diagnosis.','1,2,3'),(16,'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Left ventricular hypertrophy, or LVH occurs when the left pumping chamber of the heart becomes thicker and is less efficient at pumping blood. The heart muscle can be overworked by problems such as aortic stenosis or high blood pressure. As a result of this pressure overload, the inner walls of the heart may become thicker. Thickened walls may cause the left ventricle to become weak, stiff, and lose elasticity, thereby inhibiting the flow of blood.\n\nThere may be no symptoms associated with LVH for many years. If the condition worsens, the following symptoms may develop:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n- Fatigue\n- Chest pain (especially with exercise)\n- Heart palpitations\n- Dizziness or fainting','1,2,3'),(17,'Pulmonary hypertension','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Pulmonary hypertension refers to high blood pressure in the vessels supplying the lungs (pulmonary arteries). In this condition, the right side of the heart is at risk of damage.\n\nThe walls of the pulmonary arteries become thickened and stiffened and cannot expand fully to allow blood to pass through. As a result of the reduced blood flow, the right side of the heart has difficulty pumping blood through the arteries.\n\nWhenever the right side of the heart is forced to perform harder work, it can gradually become weaker. Eventually, this can lead to heart failure.\n\nPulmonary hypertension occurs in people of all ages but is more prevalent in people with another heart or lung disorder.\n\nSymptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n- Fatigue\n- Dizziness or faintness\n- Chest pain\n- Racing heartbeats (palpitations)\n- Swelling (oedema) in the legs, ankles, feet, or abdomen',''),(18,'Endocarditis','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Endocarditis is a fatal infection of the heart\'s inner lining (the endocardium). Typically, it is caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and traveling to the heart.\n\nThe heart is usually well protected against infection, but people with the following conditions may be more susceptible to infection:\n\n- An artificial (prosthetic) heart valve – replacement of a narrowed heart valve\n- Congenital heart disease – the condition of being born with a defective heart\n- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – enlargement of the heart\'s muscle cells and thickening of its walls\n- Damaged heart valves – caused by infection or heart disease\n\nEndocarditis symptoms are similar to the flu and may include:\n\n- High temperatures\n- Chills\n- Headache\n- Pain in the joints and muscles\n\nAs a result of the infection, the heart valves are damaged, which disrupts the normal flow of blood.','3'),(19,'Myocarditis','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Myocarditis is a serious, but rare, condition in which inflammation develops in the myocardium, which is the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis weakens the heart and its electrical system. As a result, the heart\'s ability to pump blood becomes impaired.\n\nIt is often unclear what causes myocarditis. Myocarditis is usually caused by viral infections (e.g. colds and flu), bacteria (e.g. diphtheria or strep), or fungal infections (e.g. candidiasis). It may also be caused by medications, autoimmune disorders, or toxic substances.\n\nSymptoms of myocarditis may include:\n\n- Fatigue\n- Shortness of breath\n- Fever\n- Chest pain\n- Heartbeats that are rapid, irregular, or hard\n- Lightheadedness or fainting\n- Flu-like symptoms such as headaches, body aches, joint pains, or sore throats','1,3'),(20,'Pericarditis','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, a sac-like structure with two thin layers of tissue surrounding the heart to support it. There are several factors that can contribute to pericarditis, including viral, bacterial, fungal, and other infections. A heart attack or heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries, or medications may also contribute to pericarditis.\n\nPericarditis can cause chest pains and high temperatures. It is not usually harmful, but it can cause serious health problems in some cases.\n\nYou have sudden chest pain that:\n\n- Spreads to the arms, back, neck, or jaw of the patient\n- Feels tight or heavy in the chest\n- Began with shortness of breath, sweating, and a feeling of illness\n- Over 15 minutes in duration','1'),(21,'Rheumatic heart disease','Learn heart conditions to improve your health.','Rheumatic heart disease is the most common type of heart disease in people under the age of 25. Generally, rheumatic heart disease begins as a sore throat caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) that can be transmitted easily from one person to the next. It is most common for children to suffer from Strep infections.\n\nIn some people, repeated strep infections can lead to an immune response against tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation and scarring of the heart valves. This is commonly referred to as a rheumatic fever. As a result of rheumatic fever, heart valves are irritated and scarred resulting in rheumatic heart disease.\n\nSymptoms of rheumatic fever may include:\n\n- Fever\n- Joint pain, especially in knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists\n- Pain that moves between different joints\n- Fatigue\n- Uncontrollable movements of the body (chorea)\n- Painless nodules under the skin near joints and/or a rash consisting of pink rings with a clear center (both rare)\n- Heart murmur\n\nSymptoms of heart valve damage associated with rheumatic heart disease may include:\n\n- Chest pain or discomfort\n- Shortness of breath\n- Swelling of the stomach, hands, or feet\n- Fatigue\n- Heartbeats that are rapid or irregular','');
